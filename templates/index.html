      <h4>What</h4>
      <p>This is an app that returns a random internet station and plays it</p>
      <h4>Why</h4>
      <p>
        I listen to music and podcasts all the time when I work. The issue is,
        because I consume so much of it, the algorithm has overfitted itself. I
        find myself listening to the same DJ set from Ultra or band at Coachella
        over and over again, simply because nothing new is showing up and i cant
        be arsed to search. With this, I have no control over what it decides to
        play me. If I like what its playing, it can continue, but if I don't,
        it's on to the next one.
